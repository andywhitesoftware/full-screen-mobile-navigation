# full-screen-mobile-navigation

This project demonstrates how a mobile hamburger menu works by allowing the user to select a direction they would like to see the menu slide from. The possible directions are: top, left, and right. This menu also works on widescreen devices such as tablets, laptops, and desktops. It does NOT allow the user to navigate to another page. This project only contains a basic hamburger menu created using HTML, CSS, Flexbox and 90 lines of vanilla JavaScript to control the menu functionality.
